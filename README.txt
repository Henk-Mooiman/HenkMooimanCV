Virtual CV by Henk Mooiman, for Henk Mooiman

I created this portfolio website as a short summary of who I am, and what I have already achieved,
although that might not be much it is still worth listing.

I Coded this website with HTML, for the elements, CSS for the visual aspect of the website, and JavaScript 
for the basic functionality I have included.

I wrote this code in Visual Studio Code, code editor and used a github repository to back up my code, and work.

After I completed the CV, I enabled a build in functionality of github called github-pages to host my virtualCV 
for the world to see.
